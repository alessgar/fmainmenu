Thank you for purchasing my addon!

You will find that setting this up is quite different from most addons.
Simply open the console once connected to a server and run "fmainmenu_config"
A GUI will then open to let you edit values and preview changes before saving.

By default, only superadmins will be able to edit the config, but the access system works through the following ways:

No Admin Mod: 	Usergroup set in config and above can make edits
ULX: 		Permission is created (FMainMenu_CanEditMenu). Groups who have it can make edits.
FAdmin:		Permission is created (FMainMenu_CanEditMenu). Groups who have it can make edits.

If you need any assistance, do not hesitate to make a support ticket or join my support discord at https://discord.gg/87rBPFa (proof of purchase will be required)

This is my first commercially sold addon, and I have spent hundreds of hours devloping all the systems
needed from scratch and bringing them all together, so I hope you enjoy this addon!
