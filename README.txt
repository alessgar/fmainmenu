Thank you for purchasing my addon!

You will find that setting this up is quite different from most addons.
Simply open the console once connected to a server and run "fmainmenu_config"
A GUI will then open to let you edit values and preview changes before saving.

By default, only superadmins will be able to edit the config, and it will use the gmod built-in admin system to determine who is allowed to edit, but these can both be changed in the configuration menu.

If you need any assistance, do not hesitate to make a support ticket or join my support discord at https://discord.gg/87rBPFa (proof of purchase will be required)

This is my first commercially sold addon, and I have spent hundreds of hours devloping all the systems
needed from scratch and bringing them all together, so I hope you enjoy this addon!
